# What my Project does 
My website highlights the best book shops in Cork city and supplies podcasts and reading music. It also provides useful information about kidâ€™s resources. 

# User stories 
As a reader: I can browse through the site and find out about what the bookshops have to offer.
As a reader with kids: I can find book shops with kids books and kids resources for reading and learning.
As a new reader: I can find information on how to find something engaging to read based on my interests.

## Future Features 
I would add extended list of bookshops and resources for readers covering other cities and towns. This feature was far beyond the scope of this project. 

## Testing 
I did testing on Lighthouse regularly throughout the development process to ensure my updates were efficient in every way.
