# What my Project does 
My website highlights the best book shops in Cork city on the Explore page and supplies reading music for users to enjoy on the Tune In page. 
It also provides useful information about kidâ€™s resources. 
Users can chose to sign up to a newsletter for future updates.
My site is primarily aimed at readers, especially those with children, tohelp them find bookshops with plenty of resources.

# User stories 
### As a reader: 
I can browse through the site and find out about what the bookshops have to offer. 
I can listen to effective reading music within the site.

### As a reader with kids: 

I can find book shops with kids books and kids resources for reading and learning.

### As a new reader: 

I can find information on how to find something engaging to read based on my interests.

## Features

Landing Page: There are three sections where the user can read information on three great bookshops in the city of Cork. Each section tells the user a little about the shop and what they can expect to find there.

Tune In Page: There are two embedded reading music videos a user can utilize without having to leave the website. Here, the user can listen to some appropriate music while enjoying a good book.

## Future Features 
I would add extended list of bookshops and resources for readers covering other cities and towns. This feature was far beyond the scope of this project. 

I would add in podcasts on the Tune In page so users can play them within the website using controls for play pause and volume control.


## Testing 
### Lighthouse Testing
I did testing on Lighthouse regularly throughout the development process to ensure my updates were efficient in every way.

The deployed website does well on Lighthouse testing for all three pages
