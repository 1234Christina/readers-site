## Design
The color palette was chosen based on the bookshelf image,
and was generated using [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/).
Where the background is not white, pale pastels are used to make the text easy to read.

The page header is consistent across all pages, keeping the navigation and site name to the left and the bookshelf image to the right. The footer is consistent across all pages. 

For readers the size of the text is important, and on the website, the text is appropriately sized for readability. 
The colors are generally light and cheerful while not overpowering the text.
